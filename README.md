# Web Application Metrics

## Overview
The Web Application Metrics (WAM) project was developed to provide an automated method to capture performance metrics from the user perspective for a suite of web actions on a given web app.  The web actions can be customized for any web application and can be executed in a variety of scenarios for flexibility.  The WAM project utilizes a docker container to execute the actions with [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/).

## Resources
-   WAM Version Control Information:
    -   URL: git@picgitlab.nmfs.local:centralized-data-tools/web-app-metrics.git
    -   Version: 1.3 (Git tag: web_app_metrics_v1.3)

## Scenarios
-   There are three different scenarios implemented by the docker project:
    -   Local - this scenario deploys the docker container to a local docker host and connects to a local web app
    -   Remote - this scenario deploys the docker container to a remote docker host and connects to a remote web app
    -   Hybrid - this scenario deploys the docker container to a local docker host and connects to a remote web app

## Setup Procedure
-   ### Standalone Implementation
    -   \*Note: this implementation option is provided for standalone execution, where this repository is cloned and prepared for deployment and the user updates the appropriate files below and builds/runs the container  
    -   Clone the WAM repository to a working directory
    -   Update the bash script deployment configuration file ([project_deploy_config.sh](./docker/src/sh_scripts/config/project_deploy_config.sh)) with the appropriate values:
        -   project_path is the folder name of the working copy of the repository that will be used to build the container
        -   git_url is the project git URL value
    -   Execute the appropriate docker preparation script stored in the [deployment_scripts](./deployment_scripts) folder to prepare the docker container for deployment in a new working directory
        -   For example use the [prepare_docker_project.local.sh](./deployment_scripts/prepare_docker_project.local.sh) bash script to prepare the Local docker container for deployment in the c:/docker/web-app-metrics-local folder
    -   Optional updates:
        -   Update the docker compose runtime configuration file (e.g. c:/docker/web-app-metrics-local/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml) to specify repository-specific the volume names and container name
        -   Update the docker compose configuration file (e.g. c:/docker/web-app-metrics-local/docker/docker-compose.yml) to specify the volume names and image/container names for the forked project
    -   Update the login_credentials.py file in the appropriate new working directory to specify the username and password for the given web application (e.g. c:/docker/web-app-metrics-local/docker/py_scripts/lib/login_credentials.py) for the local scenario
        -   \*\*Note: Do not commit the login credentials for the given web application in the repository for security reasons
    -   Update the app_config.py file in the appropriate new working directory to specify the configuration values for the given web application (e.g. c:/docker/web-app-metrics-local/docker/py_scripts/lib/app_config.py) for the local scenario, comments are defined in the configuration file to describe the configuration variables that should be defined.
    -   Update the [app.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/app.py) to define the web actions to execute for the given web app, to capture the elapsed time for each web action, and log the standard metrics in the defined .csv file.
        -   There is a block comment defined in app.py that indicates where the custom code should be defined for a given web app
-   ### Forked Repository Implementation
    -   \*Note: this repository can be forked for a specific database instance/schema to make it easier to build and deploy the container to capture metrics for a given database instance/schema.
        -   [WAM - IBBS](https://picgitlab.nmfs.local/web-app-metrics/ibbs-web-app-metrics) is provided as an example of how to implement the forked database-specific repository
    -   Update the [app_config.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/lib/app_config.py) file to specify the configuration values for the given web application, comments are defined in the configuration file to describe the configuration variables that should be defined.
    -   Update the [app.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/app.py) to define the web actions to execute for the given web app, to capture the elapsed time for each web action, and log the standard metrics in the defined .csv file.
        -   There is a block comment defined in app.py that indicates where the custom code should be defined for a given web app
    -   Update the bash script deployment configuration file [project_deploy_config.sh](./docker/src/sh_scripts/config/project_deploy_config.sh) to specify the appropriate values:
        -   project_path is the folder name of the working copy of the repository that will be used to build the container
        -   git_url is the project git URL value
    -   Update the [README.md](./README.md) file to change the volume names, document title heading, and setup procedure accordingly
    -   Update the docker compose runtime configuration file [docker-compose.prod.yml](./docker/docker-compose.prod.yml) to specify repository-specific the volume names and container name
    -   Update the docker compose configuration file [docker-compose.yml](./docker/docker-compose.yml) to specify the volume names and image/container names for the forked project
    -   Commit the changes to the forked repository

## Building/Running Container (Standalone Implementation Only)
-   Execute the appropriate build and deploy script for the given scenario (e.g. [build_deploy_project.remote.sh](./deployment_scripts/build_deploy_project.remote.sh) for the remote scenario)

## Docker Application Processing
-   The [app.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/app.py) python script will execute when the container is executed
    -   The script will check the active project_scenario_config.sh file to determine if this is a local, remote, or hybrid scenario.    
        -   The active project_scenario_config.py file will be determined by which docker preparation script is executed (e.g. [project_scenario_config.local.sh](./docker/src/py_scripts/lib/project_scenario_config.local.py) for the [prepare_docker_project.local.sh](./deployment_scripts/prepare_docker_project.local.sh) preparation script)
    -   The python script will open a web browser on the container app to the specified web url:
        -   if the runtime value of app_location is "remote" then the app navigates to the remote_web_url before executing the defined web actions
        -   if the runtime value of app_location is "local" then the app navigates to the local_web_url before executing the defined web actions
    -   Next, the script will execute all of the web actions defined in the [app.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/app.py) python script
         -   The performance metrics will be saved to a comma-delimited file with a name of the csv_output_file variable value defined in [app_config.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/lib/app_config.py) in the data volume (defined in [docker-compose.prod.yml](./docker/docker-compose.prod.yml))
        -   All log messages generated by the container app will be appended to a log file with a name of the log_file_prefix variable value defined in [app_config.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/lib/app_config.py) in the logs volume (defined in [docker-compose.prod.yml](./docker/docker-compose.prod.yml)), the log file name will be appended with the date in YYYYMMDD format with a ".log" file extension.

## Checking Results
-   Open the docker volume web-app-metrics-logs to view the log files for the different executions of the docker container
-   Open the docker volume web-app-metrics-data to view the exported data files for the different queries
    -   Open the file that with a file name defined in the csv_output_file variable value defined in [app_config.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/lib/app_config.py) in the data volume (defined in [docker-compose.prod.yml](./docker/docker-compose.prod.yml)) to view the metrics that were captured for each web action

## Standard Metrics/Information Logging
-   The following metrics and information is captured for each web action in a .csv file:
    -   App Name - The name of the web application being evaluated (defined in the app_name variable defined in [app_config.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/lib/app_config.py))
    -   Metrics App Location - The location of this Web App Metrics docker app the metrics will be captured by (defined in container_location of the active project_scenario_config.py file for the given scenario - e.g. [project_scenario_config.remote.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/lib/project_scenario_config.remote.py) for the remote scenario)
    -   Web App Location - The location of the Web App the metrics will be captured from (defined in app_location of the active project_scenario_config.py file for the given scenario - e.g. [project_scenario_config.remote.py](./docker/src/py_scripts/lib/project_scenario_config.remote.py) for the remote scenario)
    -   Date/Time - The Date/Time the given web action was started in MM/DD/YYYY HH:MI:SS AM/PM format
    -   Page Name - The title tag from the page the web action was executed on
    -   Action - The type of web action
    -   # Files - The total number of web resource files (e.g. image, css, JavaScript file, etc.) downloaded for the given web action
    -   Total File Size (KB) - The total size in kilobytes of the web resource files downloaded for the given web action
    -   Total Response Time (s) - The total number of seconds for the web action to complete and the app is ready to accept user interactions
    -   Screenshot file name - the name of the screenshot file saved in the data volume for the given web action

## Implemented Web Actions
-   \*Note: This depends on the web app that the actions are being executed on, see [WAM - IBBS](https://picgitlab.nmfs.local/web-app-metrics/ibbs-web-app-metrics) as an example of the web actions that are implemented in the IBBS app
